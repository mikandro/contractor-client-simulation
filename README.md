## TypeScript Update

This project has been updated to use TypeScript.

Key updates made include:

- All JavaScript files have been converted to TypeScript (`.ts` files).
- Added type annotations across the project, especially for models, services, and controllers.
- Improved type safety by defining custom types and interfaces where applicable.
- Added Sequelize model definitions using TypeScript.

## Further Improvements

While the current version has implemented a significant number of changes, there are still several improvements that can be made to the project:

1. **Unit Tests for Services**: Currently, the project has tests for some endpoints. Adding more comprehensive unit tests for service methods will help ensure reliability and correctness.

2. **Error Handling Improvements**: Introduce a more comprehensive error handling mechanism, potentially using an error handling library or a consistent error class to streamline and improve error messages.

3. **Validation Layer**: Implement validation logic using a library like `Joi` or `class-validator` to ensure that all input data is validated before being processed by controllers or services.

4. **Logging**: Add a logging framework to provide better insights during debugging and monitor issues during runtime.

5. **Environment Management**: Introduce environment variables using `dotenv` to handle different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.
